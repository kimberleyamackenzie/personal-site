                    <p>BEtsy was a four-person project at Ada where we were taked with creating an e-commerce site in Rails.
                        Learning goals included implementing a user-based application logic, user authentication through
                        OAuth, core comprehension of the MVC model, as well as agile practices. For our landing page, I wanted
                        to highlight our occult theme with an eye-catching feature. I utilized an HTML Canvas element and
                        Javascript to build a nod to a crystal ball, with smoke wafting inside.

                <div class='project-info'>
                    <p>Over the course of one “Labweek,” worked with a partner to build a basic digital synthesizer as a single-page
                        application. The app uses WebAudio and Canvas elements to demonstrate how to do sound synthesis in
                        Javascript. I was responsible for building the User Interface and visual representations of wavetables.
                        Ultimately, we succeeding in creating a session-based synthesizer, where users can control frequency
                        (arbitrarily or using musical notes to guide), the type(s) of waveform(s) to serve as the basis of
                        the sound, and the ASDR envelope for volume to create sounds; can see those sounds visually represented
                        as waveforms and how the waveforms change based on different controls, and save and playback those
                        waveforms on keypress.
                        <br> One of the most exciting features for me to build was the representation of the waveform itself.
                        Using the collection of sound sample data that is used to play the sound, I created a path in a Canvas
                        element that uses the sample data as relative coordinates. A three second sound has more than 100,000
                        samples, so we found that it was visualizing the data on a high level (particularly helpful with
                        seeing the effects of the ASDR envelope), but you weren’t able to see the true quality of the waveform
                        on a millisecond level. To solve this problem, I built a ‘magnifying glass’ feature that takes the
                        x-position of the user’s mouse on a hover event, cross-references that with stored x-positions of
                        the initial waveform, and redraws a new Canvas element and path using only a range of 250 above and
                        below the value at that x-position.

                        Stemming from a project focused on binding interactivity with HTML elements, after building a basic keyboard with HTML, CSS,
                        and Javascript, I decided to challenge myself to experiment with Canvas elements and create a less
                        predictable experience. My goal was to create shapes using Javascript that would change each session,
                        and had a more organic quality than CSS-built shapes. I attached sounds to HTML Canvas elements that
                        are generated on load using random calculations of Bezier curves to offer a consistently unique experience.
                        On click, the user can trigger the sound that is bound to that shape, and through a variety of clicks,
                        could play a simple composition. As my ultimate goal was to create a 'keyboard' that was very different
                        than the static experience usually associtated with music composition, my next challenge was to have
                        these shapes move around the user's screen, but never extend the screen or fully exit the view.

                        Muncher is a recipe search website where a user can search with an ingredient, and a variety of recipes that utilize that
                        ingredient will be returned. Clicking on any receipe in the search results will provide further details
                        about that recipe, including nutrition facts, allergens, and a link to the full recipe on the web.
                        The primary learning goals of this project were to configure an API for consumption, make authenticated
                        API requests using HTTParty, consume the JSON responses, and map the responses using application-specific
                        logic. Additionally, I implemnted pagination of the results and a responsive layout. When approaching
                        this project from a layout and styling point of view, I knew that my application was simply a stop
                        between the API that held all the information and the sites across the internet that held the full
                        recipe (presumably a user's ultimate goal)- knowing that I would have to engage a user to use my
                        application, rather than just an internet search, I wanted to implement a clear, clean, and consistent
                        design that appeal to users.

                        Our static site was our first full project utilizing HTML and CSS. We were tasked with making ourselves a personal site that
                        would feature information about us and our project work (pretty meta, huh?). Since I knew I would
                        likely be changing and evolving my skills over the subsequent months and creating a different site
                        as my ultimate portfolio, I decided to focus in on a garish theme. What I ultimately created came
                        from challenging myself to achieve particular visual goals using only CSS and HTML. I was able to
                        create a rotating cube entirely from CSS elements. I also creating 'glowing' text on hover to emphasize
                        my '90's-video-game-retro concept.

                        The primary goal of Trek was to build a single-page web application that would query an API using AJAX to display information
                        about all trips available for booking, see further details about specific trips, and allow users
                        to claim their spots on those trips. After implemnting this core functionality, I recreated the project
                        with similar functionality but using Backbone models, collections, and event workflow and Underscore
                        templates. I used communicated both server-side and client-side validations to the user, and built
                        a modal for booking spaces on a trip, so as to not disrupt the user's trip-browsing experience.
