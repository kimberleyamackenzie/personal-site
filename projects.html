                    <p>As part of a four-person team, I created an e-commerce site with Rails. Learning goals included implementing
                        a user-based application logic, user authentication through OAuth, core comprehension of the MVC
                        model, as well as agile practices. My role focused on design and front-end development, in addition
                        to working on the model and controller for users' carts. For our landing page, I wanted to highlight
                        the occult theme our store had by creating an eye-catching feature. I utilized an HTML Canvas element
                        and Javascript to build a nod to a crystal ball, with smoke wafting inside. By using numerous pixel-sized
                        images of a smoke particle, and constantly changing their opacity and directionality, I was able
                        to achieve the desired effect.

            <h1>AudioMorph</h1>

            <div class='project-all'>
                <div class='project-info'>
                    <p>Over the course of a week, I worked with a partner to build a basic digital synthesizer as a single-page
                        application. The app uses Javascript, WebAudio, and Canvas elements to demonstrate a basic roadmap
                        for sound synthesis. I was responsible for building the user interface as well as the visual representations
                        of wavetables. Users can control frequency, the type(s) of waveform(s) that serve as the basis of
                        the sound, and the ASDR envelope for volume, all to create sounds; can see those sounds visually
                        represented as waveforms and how the waveforms change based on different controls; and save and playback
                        those waveforms on keypress.
                        <br>
                        <br>One of the most exciting features for I built was the representation of the waveform itself. Using
                        the same collection of sound sample data that is used to play the sound, I created a path in a Canvas
                        element that uses the sample data as relative coordinates. A three second sound has more than 100,000
                        samples, so we found that it was visualizing the data on a high level (particularly helpful with
                        seeing the effects of the ASDR envelope), but you weren’t able to see the true quality of the waveform
                        on a millisecond level. To solve this problem, I built a ‘magnifying glass’ feature that takes the
                        x-position of the user’s mouse on a hover event, cross-references that with stored x-positions of
                        the initial waveform, and redraws a new Canvas element and path using only a range of 250 above and
                        below the value at that x-position.

                        Stemming from a project focused on binding interactivity with HTML elements, after building a basic keyboard with HTML, CSS,
                        and Javascript, I decided to challenge myself to experiment with Canvas elements and create a less
                        predictable experience. My goal was to create shapes using Javascript that would change each session,
                        and had a more organic quality than CSS-built shapes. I attached sounds to HTML Canvas elements that
                        are generated on load using random calculations of Bezier curves to offer a consistently unique experience.

                        <br>
                        <br>On click, the user can trigger the sound that is bound to that shape, and through a variety of clicks,
                        could play a simple composition. As my ultimate goal was to create a 'keyboard' that was very different
                        than the static experience usually associtated with music composition, my next challenge was to have
                        these shapes move around the user's screen, but never extend the screen or fully exit the view. I
                        accomplished this by triggering animations that move from one x-y point to another, always checking
                        the current position of the element against the bounds of the viewport, and triggering a new animation
                        when the element is beyond the viewport. You can explore this project on your own

                        Muncher is a recipe search website where a user can enter an ingredient search term, and a variety of recipes that utilize
                        that ingredient will be returned. Clicking on any receipe in the search results will provide further
                        details about that recipe, including nutrition facts, allergens, and a link to the full recipe on
                        the web. The primary learning goals of this project were to configure an API for consumption, make
                        authenticated API requests using HTTParty, consume the JSON responses, and map the responses using
                        application-specific logic.
                        <br>
                        <br>I additionally implemented pagination of the results and a responsive layout. When approaching this
                        project from a layout and styling point of view, I knew that my application was simply a stop between
                        the API that held all the information and the sites across the internet that held the full recipe
                        (presumably a user's ultimate goal)- knowing that I would have to engage a user to use my application,
                        rather than just an internet search, I wanted to implement a clear, clean, and consistent design
                        that appeal to users.

                        This static site was my first full project utilizing HTML and CSS. Since I knew I would likely be changing and evolving my
                        skills over the subsequent months and creating a different site as my ultimate portfolio, I decided
                        to focus in on a fun theme that allowed me to explore the capabilities of CSS. What I ultimately
                        created came from challenging myself to achieve particular visual goals using only CSS and HTML.
                        <br>
                        <br>I was able to create a rotating cube using only CSS elements. I implemented this by working with
                        each cube face indepedently of the form itself, with a combination of translations and rotations
                        on its X, Y, and Z axis and transform origin points. I also created 'glowing' text on hover to emphasize
                        my '90's-video-game-retro concept.

                        The primary goal of Trek was to build a single-page web application that would query an API using AJAX to display information
                        about all trips available for booking, see further details about specific trips, and allow users
                        to claim their spots on those trips. After implemnting this core functionality, I recreated the project
                        with similar functionality but using Backbone models, collections, and event workflow and Underscore
                        templates. I used communicated both server-side and client-side validations to the user, and built
                        a modal for booking spaces on a trip, so as to not disrupt the user's trip-browsing experience.

                        Ada culminates with a three-week capstone project, where I was challenged with building work using a minimum of three new
                        programming languages or technologies. My primary personal goals were to explore hardware and to
                        build interactivity that didn't require a user to directly engage with a screen. Using a Xbox Kinect,
                        C++, and the OpenFrameworks library, I built a program that performs skeletal tracking to create
                        a soundscape and visualization that is responsive to users' movements.
                        <br>
                        <br>By tracking the position of a user's joints and limbs in space, my program's algorithm uses X, Y,
                        and Z positions to trigger different sounds and transforms those sounds based on the user's body
                        span and speed of movements. Simultaneously, a mesh is being built with a vertex plotted and connected
                        for each joint's position in space.
